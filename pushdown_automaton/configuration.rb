# Just like a transition/rule in finite automaton defined a move
# from one state to another, in a pushdown automaton a rule defines
# a move from one configuration (combination of state and stack contents) to another
# 
# Metadata: 
#   â€¢ We can record the sequence of rules followed thus far to get to the configuration.
#     This will help provide information on building a parse tree if necessary if the
#     configuration has an accept state.
